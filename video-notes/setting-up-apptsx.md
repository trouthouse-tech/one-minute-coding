Welcome to One Minute Coding Episode 1!

I just ran `npx create-expo-app@latest` and now have a bare Expo project.

I don't use `expo-router` and instead use `react-navigation`. Expo includes React Navigation by default so no need to install any packages.

In this video, we will be focusing on updating the entry point of our project to be src/App.tsx.

Before this video, I also ran `npx expo run:ios` which will create the ios/ directory for us and run the app.
